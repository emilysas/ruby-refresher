#Ruby Refresher

This was the personal weekend challenge for week 8 of Makers Academy. Having spent two weeks looking at javascript, the aim was to refresh our knowledge of ruby prior to learning Rails the following week.


To run the specs, just run

~~~
$ rspec questions_spec.rb
~~~


### Rules

* Try and get the RSpec tests to pass (but not by cheating - i.e. hardcoding the expected value)
* You shouldn't need any extra libraries or gems
* The cleaner your code the better!
* Googling is fine as usual
